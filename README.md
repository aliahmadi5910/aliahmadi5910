Hi, I’m ali ahmadi.
I started working and learning in the field of programming about 15 years ago. My first field of work was designing Android mobile applications, and little by little I started working on designing a variety of static and dynamic websites. I am currently a full stack developer in the field of Android mobile applications and php and Laravel websites. Android Studio and Laravel are my most specialized.
I’m currently learning Vue.js
